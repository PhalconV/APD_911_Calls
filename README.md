#### **Duration**
28/10/2024 - (3 Weeks)  

#### **Overview**
This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from 952,833 emergency calls handled by the Austin Police Department (APD) between 2021 and 2024. The project focuses on improving response times, addressing mental health-related incidents, and optimizing resource allocation using Python, SQL, and Tableau.  

#### **Key Findings**
- **911 Call Volume:** Total calls were 952,828, with 2022 seeing the highest volume.  
- **Response Times:** The average response time was 2,254 seconds, with delays increasing closer to 2024.  
- **Critical Incidents:** Mental health-related calls rose by 12% from the previous year.  
- **Resource Allocation:** High-density areas experienced slower response times due to uneven officer distribution.  

#### **Recommendations**
- Optimize officer deployment to high-call-density areas during peak hours.  
- Provide training for mental health crisis intervention.  
- Utilize predictive analytics for better resource planning.  
- Promote community engagement to reduce non-emergency 911 calls.
