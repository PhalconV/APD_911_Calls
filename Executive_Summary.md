## Executive Summary
Over the years, incident-related issues have risen significantly, leading to an increase in 911 calls. This has necessitated a shift in strategy, ensuring officers are dispatched only to incidents that cannot be resolved over the phone. To support this approach, this report analyzes over Nine Hundred and Fifty-Two Thousand, Eight Hundred and Thirty-Three (952833) 911 calls to enhance emergency response efficiency, assess the mental health impact of critical incidents, and evaluate the effectiveness of resource allocation.
Using Python and SQL, we identified key trends, assessed performance metrics, and highlighted critical safety concerns. The findings aim to optimize unit dispatch processes, prioritize resources effectively, and ensure timely responses to the most urgent situations.
